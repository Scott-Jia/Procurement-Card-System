# Procurement-Card-System

The target university issued procurement cards to its employees and students to increase the efficiency of the purchasing and payment process. University Staff and students who want to get the procurement card must complete the application, and these applications will be reviewed and signed by appropriate deans or administrative officers. Besides, the transaction record would be reviewed by editors and reconcilers, and posted on the system.

In order to analyze and design the whole procurement card system, our team provides four methods, EER diagram, MySQL, Datalog, and Protege. In the memo, we will discuss each methodâ€™s advantages and disadvantages, and finally come out with recommendations to help our client, the department of purchasing division at the target university, to make decisions.
